# JTerminalApp
#### It is a small framework which can be used to compose terminal apps on UNIX systems
I made a snake game in the terminal for fun during one weekend, then generalized out this framework from it.

I take the Unity framework as an example when I designed the mechanism of the game objects in terms of extending
them and override their update method to get a unique behavior during frame updates in the engine. My game loop
is not too sophisticated but it is working :D
